# DANGER!

I have bricked one set of lights by sending invalid data to them.  Use this repo at your own risk.

You should not write a value greater than 11, or maybe even 10, when setting a mode.

## Home Assistant

There is a Home Assistant custom component to let you control these lights.  You probably shouldn't use it yet.
